# Troubleshooting

## I have networking issues 

If you have issues with the network on your please check the following:

1. Make sure the jumper switched to a boot mode
2. Check the ethernet switch and network chips for extra solder paste. If you see some tiny silver balls around the chip, just scrape them away with a needle or any other tool.
